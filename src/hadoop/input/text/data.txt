3	BEGINNING THE VOYAGE
4	
5	
6	_August 28th._--Events follow each other so fast that they get confused
7	in the memory.
8	
9	The return from the club in the morning, a frightened wife with a
10	telegram, the rush from Petersburg to Cronstadt, hurried calls,
11	appointment to the _Suvaroff_, good-byes, send-offs, a new service,
12	etc., etc.
13	
14	I am not yet accustomed to my new surroundings.
15	
16	To-day I bade good-bye to the captain and officers of the _Borodino_,
17	and to the foremen and workmen. They wished me good luck, drank my
18	health, cheered, and the band played. They evidently had a very
19	friendly disposition towards me.
20	
21	The parting with the foremen and workmen was cordial. It was very sad
22	to see their doleful faces. They all cried before the end of their
23	farewell speeches. I kissed all and thanked them. They blessed me
24	with the ikon of St. Nicholas. I promised to give them my photograph
25	as a memento. I had nothing else to repay them with. I could think of
26	nothing better.
27	
28	_August 30th._--Yesterday we left Cronstadt. The Emperor overtook the
29	fleet in the _Alexandria_, and steamed round it. All the time bands
30	were playing, the men cheered, the fleet saluted. It was a superb
31	sight. At times the smoke from the guns was so thick that the nearest
32	ships were not visible. To-day we arrived at Revel at 7 a.m. It is said
33	we are to remain here for nearly a month.
34	
35	To-day is the _Suvaroff's_ name-day. There was mass. No festivities.
36	
37	8 p.m.--Such a worry. Nowhere can I find room for myself. When I was
38	working on board the _Borodino_, as you may imagine, I constantly
39	consoled myself with the thought of rest and of leave. The _Borodino_
40	is completed. I might now have been free, might now have been living
41	at home with my wife. But ah! fate! It seems to me that I shall not
42	return. My predecessor in this cabin that I occupy went mad and was
43	retired. This may be superstition, but it is nevertheless unpleasant.
44	It is said that to-day the captain of the _Asia_ momentarily lost his
45	head and steered his ship to ram the _Apraxin_; the presence of mind of
46	the officer of the watch saved the _Asia_ and _Apraxin_ from damage.
47	
48	_October 3rd._--At sea, on the way to the island of Bornholm. Time
49	flies. Daily there are new impressions, worries, gossip, and work. On
50	the eve of our departure from Libau there was prayer, with genuflexions
51	for "Boyarin Zenovie."[1]
52	
53	Yesterday we had vespers, and to-day mass. Everything so triumphant
54	and showy! The weather was glorious. At lunch the band played.
55	Suddenly it was reported that the torpedo-boat _Buistry_ (Rapid) had
56	rammed the _Oslyabya_--had knocked a hole in herself and damaged her
57	torpedo-tubes. The _Buistry_ approached the _Suvaroff_. With the
58	help of a megaphone (_i.e._ a large speaking-trumpet) the admiral
59	conversed with her. They managed to plug the holes. It will be my work
60	to mend them. We shall anchor off Bornholm, where I hope to repair
61	the torpedo-boat. To-night there will be danger. We shall all sleep
62	in our clothes and all guns will be loaded. We shall pass through a
63	narrow strait. We are afraid of striking on Japanese mines in these
64	waters. Perhaps there will be no mines; but considering that long ago
65	Japanese officers went to Sweden and, it is said, swore to destroy
66	our fleet, we must be on our guard. This strait is eminently suitable
67	for torpedo-boat attacks or for laying down mines. When you get this
68	letter we shall have passed the dangerous place, and it is no use your
69	worrying yourself about it.
70	
71	Have things gone badly with Kuropatkin again? How serious it is! Will
72	there ever be an end to our reverses?
73	
74	4 p.m.--We have passed the island of Bornholm without stopping. The
75	southern shores of Sweden were visible. On the way we met a good many
76	steamers. We are steaming with the greatest precaution. The fleet is
77	split into several divisions, steaming at a certain distance from
78	one another. Each division is surrounded by torpedo-boats. Whenever
79	a steamer or sailing-ship is observed on our course or coming toward
80	us, a torpedo-boat goes ahead and clears the way--that is, drives them
81	aside.
82	
83	It is a pretty sight--a torpedo-boat going full speed gliding swiftly
84	over the sea like a snake. Being low in the water, it can scarcely be
85	seen from afar.
86	
87	_October 4th._--At anchor off the coast of Denmark, opposite the island
88	of Langeland (Longland). On board the transport _Kamchatka_.
89	
90	Ah me, what a day it has been! We had scarcely arrived at Langeland
91	when I went on board the torpedo-boat _Buistry_, not having even drunk
92	my coffee. I put on high boots and took my mackintosh. The _Buistry_
93	approached the _Kamchatka_ and the work began. I got as black as the
94	devil in the bunker. I must have new overalls. I shall buy some cloth
95	somewhere and give it to a sailor to make.
96	
97	High boots are invaluable, but it is a pity they do not come above the
98	knee, as I sometimes have to crawl and spoil my trousers, just as I did
99	to-day. The work in the _Buistry_ is tremendous. The wind freshened.
100	The torpedo-boat rolled. We should have worked outboard, but there was
101	too much sea on; she rolled her deck under. The artificers will work
102	all night at the inside, and perhaps to-morrow they may be able to
103	do outside repairs. Towards the evening it blew so hard that it was
104	useless thinking of getting on board the _Suvaroff_. It is very cramped
105	in the torpedo-boat, and she is still rolling very heavily. I went
106	over to the _Kamchatka_. I do not yet know if I shall get a cabin to
107	sleep in. I brought very few cigarettes with me. Here, off Langeland,
108	are a Danish cruiser and a torpedo-boat guarding our anchorage from
109	the Japanese, who might fire a torpedo at us. There are Danish pilots
110	in each ship, as well as in the torpedo-boats. Once we are out of the
111	Baltic, the danger from mines will be passed.
112	
113	I am sitting in the wardroom of the _Kamchatka_, where I have found
114	some paper on which I am scribbling. If the weather does not abate
115	I shall have to stay in the _Kamchatka_ until we reach the next
116	anchorage. They have just come to report that there are no spare
117	hammocks. I shall have to spend the night on a sofa in the wardroom,
118	without undressing. Well, that is no hardship!
119	
120	I shall sleep somehow, as I am very tired.
121	
122	_October 15th_, 12 noon.--At 9 a.m. I went from the _Buistry_ to the
123	_Suvaroff_. Find the consul is just leaving. I fastened my letter No. 3
124	somehow, unsigned, and gave it to the consul without a stamp. I think
125	it will reach you.
126	
127	At eleven o'clock I went to lunch with the admiral, who conferred on me
128	the Order of St. Anne. This came as a surprise to me. The order with
129	the ribbon was sent to me. The admiral is promoted to vice-admiral and
130	aide-de-camp to the Czar.
131	
132	3 p.m.--I lay down hoping to rest, but it was not to be; I had to go
133	to the _Sissoi_--her davits had broken. They could not lower a single
134	cutter. Off I went. Here we are at our first anchorage, and already
135	there are a heap of damages. The _Buistry_ is damaged; there are
136	breakages in the _Sissoi_: in the _Jemchug_ the davits broke and a
137	cutter sank.
138	
139	Three Danish steamers which coaled us are damaged. The owners assess
140	the damages at 6,000 roubles (£600). I shall have to go and look at
141	them.
142	
143	I do not take into account minor mishaps, such as the torpedo-boat
144	_Prozorlivy_ (Clearsighted), which struck her bows somewhere, and of
145	course bent them. She was, however, able to cope with the leak herself.
146	
147	_October 6th._--On the way to Cape Skaw.
148	
149	Another mishap to the _Orel_ (Eagle).[2] At a most critical moment,
150	when we were going through a narrow strait, her rudder was injured. She
151	anchored. The damage is not yet ascertained. There is probably some
152	scoundrel on board who has been trying all along to injure the ship.
153	It is supposed to be one of the crew. We got up anchor at 7 a.m. The
154	weather is fair, but it appears to be freshening. The wind is beginning
155	to get much stronger, although the sun is still shining, and there is
156	not much sea.
157	
158	It is warm here, 12° to 13° R.
159	
160	The _Orel_ weighed anchor and followed the fleet.
161	
162	_October 7th._--We are not yet up to the Skaw. Shall be there soon. The
163	weather is very fine again. I wonder what it will be like in the German
164	Ocean. We have to put our watches back now.
165	
166	It is 8.30 on board at this moment. In Petersburg it is probably not
167	yet 8 o'clock.
168	
169	I occasionally look at a book, _The English Self-teacher_, but I do not
170	get on with it; sometimes I am lazy, and sometimes people interrupt me.
171	
172	At anchor off the Skaw. There is no communication with the shore except
173	through the pilot. I gave my letter No. 4 to him to post. Sending a
174	telegram is out of the question. At present we have stopped at sea, and
175	are not off a port. We were anxious about the _Orel_ all night. As I
176	have already told you, she left the fleet, no longer answered signals,
177	and found herself in a dangerous place. Now she is anchored with the
178	other ships.
179	
180	I write to you so often now, that when it will be difficult to send
181	letters, and they will take a long time reaching you, you are bound to
182	be anxious. In any case, I warn you of this. Of course, I shall write
183	to you as often as possible. I must finish this letter. The post goes
184	very soon in the _Ermak_.
185	
186	The next trip will be of some days' duration. We have no news of the
187	war. It is very trying. The torpedo-boat _Prozorlivy_ has damaged her
188	condenser, and is being sent to Libau. The _Jemchug_ lost a cutter and
189	broke the davits. The davits were taken down to-day and sent to the
190	_Kamchatka_, where, in hoisting them on board, they fell into the water
191	and sank.
192	
193	How strict discipline is now! A signal was made to the _Ermak_. She did
194	not answer, so they began firing projectiles under her stern. After
195	such a reminder she quickly responded.
196	
197	At three o'clock a Swedish steamer approached the fleet, flying a
198	signal that she had very important dispatches. Apparently the Russian
199	agent reported that a very suspicious three-masted sailing ship had
200	sailed from the fiords. An order has now been given to train all guns
201	on every passing vessel. We met ships hitherto, but the torpedo-boats
202	always drove them out of the way. We have already passed the most
203	dangerous spots. Half an hour ago it was reported to the admiral that
204	either the _Navarin_ or the _Nachimoff_ (I do not remember which) had
205	signalled that they had seen two balloons. What can this be? Can it be
206	the Japanese?
207	
208	8 p.m.--Panic prevails on board. Every one examines the sea intently.
209	The weather is glorious. It is warm. There is moonlight. The slightest
210	suspicious-looking spot in the water is carefully watched. The guns are
211	loaded. The crew are standing about on deck. One half will sleep at
212	their guns without undressing; the other half and officers will keep
213	watch to-night. It is curious that we are so far from the theatre of
214	war and yet so much alarmed. The crew treat the matter seriously.
215	
216	By the way, I will tell you the following incident. A sailor of the
217	Revel half "equipage" asked to be allowed to go to the war in one of
218	the ships. His request was refused. He thereupon climbed into the hold
219	of one of the transports and remained there until now. Imagine how many
220	days he passed in the fetid hold of the transport! Besides that, he
221	would be suspected of being a deserter--that is, to have committed a
222	severely punishable offence. No doubt they will inform Revel and keep
223	him in the fleet. A curious incident, is it not? I wish the whole thing
224	were over. Every one's nerves are strained just now. There are some
225	officers in the fleet who have returned from Port Arthur, and they say
226	that people out there are not nearly as nervous as they are in Russia.
227	
228	The following details will show you how accustomed they have grown to
229	the position. The crews of the ships at Port Arthur asked leave to go
230	to the advanced positions, and returned under the influence of liquor.
231	No one could understand how they became drunk. In the town liquors
232	were not sold, and yet men went to the advanced positions and returned
233	intoxicated. At last it was discovered, and how do you suppose? It
234	appears that the sailors went to the front in order to kill one of the
235	enemy and take away his brandy-flask. Just imagine such a thing. They
236	risked their lives to get drunk! They did all this without thinking
237	anything of it, and contrived to conceal it from the authorities.
238	
239	_October 8th._--The German Ocean (North Sea).
240	
241	What a night it has been--nerve-racking and restless. Early in the
242	evening all were in a state of nervous tension and panic. News was
243	received at midnight from the foremost ships that they had observed
244	four suspicious torpedo-boats without lights. Vigilance was redoubled,
245	but thank God the night passed happily. At present there is a fog.
246	Nothing is visible all around. The sirens which you dislike so much are
247	shrieking. I went to bed, dressed, last night, and did not cover myself
248	with the counterpane, but just threw my overalls over me. In the night
249	I froze, so covered my feet with a rug. The rug was very useful--many
250	thanks to you for it.
251	
252	We are now in the German Ocean. They say it will be rough. At present
253	it is calm, but foggy. We go from the Skaw to Brest, in France. There,
254	there will be no communication with the shore, it is said. It will be
255	strange if we arrive in the East without having once set foot on dry
256	land--and that seems likely to happen; circumnavigating the world and
257	not seeing a single town--how that would please you!
258	
259	9 p.m.--A signal has just been received (by wireless telegraphy)
260	that the _Kamchatka_, which had dropped far astern, was attacked by
261	torpedo-boats. Just off to find out details.
262	
263	10 p.m.--The _Kamchatka_ reports that she is attacked on all sides by
264	eight torpedo-boats.
265	
266	_October 9th._--Night of October 9th.
267	
268	The _Kamchatka_ is asking the position of the fleet. She says she has
269	altered course and that the torpedo-boats have gone. On board us they
270	think that the Japanese are asking the position of the fleet. The wind
271	has freshened. The _Suvaroff_ is rolling. If it continues to freshen,
272	the torpedo-boats will be obliged to give up following and make for the
273	nearest shore.
274	
275	My God! what will the fleet do then?
276	
277	About 1 a.m. they sounded off quarters, having seen ships ahead. They
278	let the ships get nearer, and then there began....
279	
280	What it was words fail to describe! All the ships of our division were
281	ablaze. The noise of the firing was incessant. The searchlights were
282	turned on. I was on the after bridge, and was positively blinded and
283	deafened by the firing. I put my hands to my ears and bolted below. The
284	rest I watched from the spar-deck, out of the accommodation-ladder port.
285	
286	A small steamer was rolling helplessly on the sea. One funnel, a
287	bridge, and the red and black paint on her side were clearly visible.
288	I saw no one on deck--they had probably hidden themselves below in
289	terror. First one, then another projectile from our ship struck this
290	unfortunate steamer. I saw there was an explosion. The order to cease
291	firing was given, but the other ships continued to fire and no doubt
292	sank the steamer. A second and third steamer not having any one on deck
293	rolled helplessly in the same fashion. The _Suvaroff_ did not fire on
294	them.
295	
296	Imagine the feelings of the people in these ships! They were, no
297	doubt, fishermen. Now there will be a universal scandal. As a matter
298	of fact they are to blame themselves. They must have known our fleet
299	was coming, and they must have known the Japanese wished to destroy it.
300	They saw the fleet. Why did they not cut adrift their nets, if they had
301	them out, and get out of the way? The nets could be paid for afterwards.
302	
303	We shall find out at Brest what we have done. If it was not the
304	_Kamchatka_, but the Japanese, who asked the position of the fleet,
305	they will now know where we are to be found. If that is the case, we
306	must expect to be attacked to-night. The moon is shining now, but from
307	4 to 6 a.m. it will be dark--the time most suitable for attack. If only
308	we could get to the open sea! We shall be perfectly safe there from
309	these accidents. I do not know whether to go to bed or not. You know
310	I always like sharing even the smallest events with you and telling
311	you of them. Take care of my letters; they are better than any diary.
312	Perhaps some day I will read them myself and refresh my memory about
313	our present excitements.
314	
315	2.30 a.m.--What a misfortune! A signal has come from the _Aurora_,
316	"Four underwater shot-holes, funnels torn, the chaplain severely
317	wounded, and a captain of a gun slightly."
318	
319	Our division fired on the _Aurora_. She and the _Dimitry Donskoi_ were
320	detached (we are in six divisions). At the time of the firing on the
321	steamers the men lost their heads. Probably some one took her to be
322	Japanese and fired on her with the six-inch guns; she was very far off.
323	A very, very sad occurrence. The only consolation is that our shooting
324	is so good.
325	
326	3.30 p.m.--The second and third steamers about which I wrote last night
327	suffered a little as well. The _Aurora's_ chaplain had his hand torn
328	off. They asked permission to call at the nearest port in order to send
329	him to hospital. The admiral refused. Six different projectiles struck
330	the _Aurora_, whose side and funnels were pierced. Comparatively few
331	were injured. The _Aurora_ is to blame for having shown herself on the
332	horizon, on the side away from us. She turned her searchlight on us,
333	and by so doing made us take her to be one of the enemy's ships.
334	
335	Yesterday, or more correctly this morning, I went to bed at six
336	o'clock. Again I did not undress. I slept by snatches, on and off all
337	day. Perhaps there will be no sleep again to-night.
338	
339	The barber has just cut my hair. He uses huge tailor's scissors with
340	cloth-covered handles. "I did not succeed in buying a proper pair," he
341	explained, when he saw me looking at his ditty box.[3] He cut it very
342	evenly for a self-taught barber.
343	
344	Whom have we not among the sailors?--tailors, bootmakers, locksmiths,
345	cooks, bakers, barbers, photographers, confectioners, cigarette makers,
346	etc. All trades are represented, and there is work for all of them in a
347	battleship. The captain wanted to be shaved, so he sent an orderly for
348	a barber. The man arrived (not the one who cut my hair) and the shaving
349	began. The barber's hand shook and the captain's face grew red with
350	blood. He had nearly taken off half his cheek. A fearful row ensued.
351	The captain, with soapy cheeks, smacked the heads of the orderly and
352	barber. The latter tried to excuse himself by saying that he is still
353	learning. A pretty picture, is it not? Now the captain shaves himself,
354	not trusting local talent.
355	
356	11 p.m.--An eventful day has gone by! At six o'clock some fishing-nets
357	fouled the screws, but the engines are working. The fishermen in these
358	parts tow very long nets, and you have to pass over them.
359	
360	We had vespers to-day. How will this night pass? The weather remains
361	fine. It is calm. The moon will shine until four o'clock. Perhaps
362	another fog will come on like last night. All this morning the sirens
363	were screeching in the fog. We shall be at the entrance of the English
364	Channel in the morning. Again they have not served out hammocks to the
365	crew. They will sleep at their guns fully dressed.
366	
367	_October 10th_ (7 p.m.).--In the English Channel, between England and
368	France.
369	
370	I have not written to you the whole day, and it is getting on my
371	conscience.
372	
373	We had mass in the morning, and then lunch. Not having slept all night,
374	I lay down to rest. I slept until 3.30. I worked and then dined. I am
375	only just free. The night passed quietly. It is raining now, and the
376	ship is gently heaving on the ocean swell. If nothing further occurs,
377	we shall be at Brest to-morrow. Passing by England this morning I saw
378	her southern shores, which were faintly visible in the mist. Yes,
379	there was "Foggy Albion." Involuntarily I pondered over this clod of
380	earth--so powerful, so rich, so proud, and so ill-disposed towards us.
381	We are only three hours' journey from London and six by rail from Paris.
382	
383	Many varieties of birds settle on the ship, tired and exhausted by
384	their long flight. The crew feed them and let them go.
385	
386	I am depressed--fearfully depressed. Anxiety presses on my soul! What
387	would I not give to be with you now! Again I have not slept all night.
388	How tiring it all is!
389	
390	_October 11th._--They say it is very possible we shall not call at
391	Brest. Profiting by the fine weather, we shall steer straight across
392	the Bay of Biscay. The bay enjoys a bad reputation. It is seldom
393	crossed in calm weather. It blows there very heavily. So far we have
394	had a very fair voyage.
395	
396	The _Korea_, which apparently called at Cherbourg, signals that she has
397	heard nothing of the fleet having fired on steamers. The torpedo-boat
398	_Bravy_ has broken something.
399	
400	Bay of Biscay.
401	
402	Fate herself prevented our going to Brest, and steered us straight
403	across the Bay of Biscay to Vigo (Spain).
404	
405	Such a thick fog came up at 1 p.m. that the ship astern was not
406	visible. We are steaming through milk! The sirens are shrieking in
407	turn, one ship after another.
408	
409	The following ships are in our division: first the _Suvaroff_, next
410	the _Alexander III._, then the _Borodino_, _Orel_, and the transport
411	_Anadir_.
412	
413	Perhaps it is just as well we did not go to Brest. The entrance to the
414	port is very difficult, dangerous, and impossible in a fog.
415	
416	If we do not go to Crete, from Vigo onwards the way before us is
417	wide--the whole ocean!
418	
419	Lying on my bed last night I watched the rats making themselves at home
420	in my cabin. I used to sleep with my feet towards the door, but have
421	now put my pillow there, because of the rats. They can jump from the
422	writing-table on to the settee, and could easily have jumped on my head.
423	
424	Since we left the port of Alexander III. at Libau, a fortnight ago,
425	no telegrams have been sent, except those allowed by the admiral.
426	This was done so that spies should not warn the Japanese, waiting for
427	us in the Baltic. The Japanese evidently thought (report said there
428	were more than a hundred of them in the Baltic) that we should wait
429	for the _Oleg_ at Libau. The admiral, however, did not wait for the
430	_Oleg_, and left. Their spies did not succeed in warning them. Though
431	telegrams were received at the office, they were not sent on for two
432	days. Perhaps this accounts for their inactivity.
433	
434	Evening.--The fog dispersed and our division reassembled. The crew will
435	sleep at their guns without undressing till we reach Vigo.
436	
437	I sit in my cabin and try to distract my thoughts. Such gloom
438	overwhelms me that I feel inclined to hang myself. I go into the
439	wardroom, take a hand at dominoes, play with the dogs, or idle about,
440	not knowing what to do with myself.
441	
442	There are three dogs who are always to be found in the wardroom of the
443	_Suvaroff_. One is a dachs called "Dinky"; the second a fox-terrier
444	puppy, "Gipsy"; and the third, "Flagmansky," is something like a dachs,
445	but white-haired and rough. Flagmansky and Gipsy are very amusing
446	animals. They are often played with and teased; corks and papers are
447	tied to them with string, and they jump and romp about. Now you know
448	all our amusements. They are not many!
449	
450	I go on deck and look at this much-vaunted sea.
451	
452	Some one has prepared Flagmansky for the tropics by cutting off all
453	the hair on his body, leaving his head like a lion's. The chaplain is
454	accused of doing this, but he denies it.
455	
456	We shall arrive at Vigo either to-night or to-morrow morning. It will
457	be interesting to know if they will allow us to coal from our transport
458	_Anadir_. Coal is getting scarce in the battleships.
459	
460	_October 12th._--We are approaching Spain. Lighthouses are already
461	visible. We shall be at Vigo in the morning. We shall all be much
462	relieved, as we have not called at a single port since we left Libau.
463	We could go on to Tangier without stopping. The weather has greatly
464	facilitated our passage.
465	
466	Admiral Folkersham, commanding the 2nd division of battleships (in it
467	are the _Sissoi_, _Oslyabya_, _Navarin_, _Nachimoff_, and another),
468	distinguished himself when passing through the English Channel. He
469	approached the English coast and coaled his ships from the transports.
470	We are all laughing to think of the horror of our Minister for Foreign
471	Affairs (by the way, all the ministers were opposed to the dispatch of
472	the fleet, but the admiral insisted on it).
473	
474	The Minister will be informed of the firing on the steamers. That will
475	be the first European complication. They will then tell him about the
476	coaling near England--a second complication. Finally he will learn that
477	a whole division of our fleet has called at the neutral port of Vigo.
478	
479	_October 13th._--In Vigo Bay.
480	
481	No communication with the shore allowed. I gave my letter No. 6, of
482	thirty-two pages, to be forwarded by the Consulate. Of course, there
483	were no stamps. I wonder if you will get it!
484	
485	We shall not remain here more than twenty-four hours. The Spanish
486	authorities do not allow a longer stay. This place is hot and sunny.
487	There were 20° R. in the shade. The place is pretty. There are hills
488	all around. The town is evidently not large.
489	
490	12 o'clock.--The authorities do not allow us to stop for a moment. In
491	order to gain time, the admiral asked the local captain of the port to
492	telegraph to Madrid, to ask that we might stay here five days to make
493	good defects. In spite of the prohibition we are about to take in coal,
494	without which our fleet would be checkmated. Sentries will be posted
495	over the hawsers (ropes which fasten the ships to the colliers), with
496	orders to allow no one to cast them off. What will be the end of all
497	this?
498	
499	A collier lies near each battleship, but they are not allowed to coal.
500	Telegrams are sent everywhere. They are now waiting for a reply from
501	Madrid. Will they really not allow us to coal!
502	
503	The admiral has received a telegram stating that England is in a
504	ferment--not at our having fired on the steamers, but because the
505	torpedo-boat which was left on the scene of the drama gave no help
506	to the sufferers. None of our torpedo-boats were there. They were at
507	Cherbourg. The admiral replied to this effect to our ambassador in
508	London.
509	
510	An answer has been received from Madrid. It announces that the
511	Government requests us to refrain from coaling, but will inform us
512	to-morrow how much we may take.
513	
514	The admiral ordered a signal to be hoisted for the fleet, to be in
515	readiness to weigh anchor at 7 a.m.
516	
517	When the admiral went ashore to-day, he was met in state. The crowd
518	made an ovation, a description of which was in the local evening papers.
519	
520	_October 14th._--I gave my letter to a soldier or police "alguazil," as
521	they call them on board. I gave him money--one peseta!
522	
523	Our battleships lie waiting. It is positively insulting! Coal, bought
524	by Russia, is in steamers close alongside and is not allowed to be
525	put on board. "Who prevents it?" you ask. Miserable, beggarly,
526	broken Spain. Undoubtedly the hand of England is visible in this. The
527	Spaniards make no secret of it.
528	
529	At 1 p.m. permission came for each ship to take in 400 tons. Sailors
530	and officers, dirty and black, hasten to begin coaling. White tunics
531	and cap-covers are nowhere to be seen. Everything is black with
532	coal-dust. Faces are black as soot, and only teeth gleam white.
533	
534	_October 18th._--They say we leave for Tangier to-morrow morning. I
535	have been busy all day, and not able to write.
